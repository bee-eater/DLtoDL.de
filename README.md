Upload your exported dives (DivingLog app) directly to DiveLogs.de!

## How to use
- Download and install the app (allow installation in Android settings from unsecure location)
- Open the app and enter your DiveLogs.de login information

Now you can either directly open an exported Logbook.sql file from the file explorer or:

- Create a folder "Diving" in the root folder of you phone (not SD card!)
- Grant permissions via the button in the app
- Select the same folder as Backup folder in DivingLog app

Everytime you export your logbook a notification should pop up! If not, just open the app up manually and you should get a popup to reopen the file!

I can't say anything about power consumption since I don't own an Android device, but if you don't want the App to run the background service for the file monitoring, you can just disable it on the main screen.
